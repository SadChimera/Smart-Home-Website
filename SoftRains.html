            <p class="content" class="flex-daddy">This modest, rustic looking house is the house of the future! This house was created by the renowed and infamous architect Joise Marries, the artist of our beautiful future. Set in the beautiful suburbs,
                where you can see the city from afar and gloat about your own freedom, under the sun and shining green grass and have a couple of dogs run around happy.
                Upgraded with most recent of technologies to create a comfortable future for you and your family! With the implementations of robotic and synthetic tech,
                the caregiver of the house wouldn't have to clean, cook, or organize anything! The children would be able to play in their nursery or the backyard with the latest
                anti-stranger guardian bots to ensure their safety! Plus, you'll be able to happily play with your children during your free time and whenever you want to. 
                Wake up early in the morning for some breakfast? Done. The bots had already made you scrambled eggs, toast, and orange juice. Need to stay awake for your baby bundle of joy? 
                The robots already got you covered, they can swaddle and feed the baby while you rest and sleep, knowing they'll be safe in your house! Kids alone in the house while you and your
                spouse are away? The house already put out their defensive measures and already called the police on home intruders! Take a preview huh?
