            <p>This modest, rustic looking house is the house of the future! This house was created by the renowed and infamous architect Joise Marries, the artist of our beautiful future. Set in the beautiful suburbs,
                where you can see the city from afar and gloat about your own freedom, under the sun and shining green grass and have a couple of dogs run around happy.
                Upgraded with most recent of technologies to create a comfortable future for you and your family! With the implementations of robotic and synthetic tech,
                the caregiver of the house wouldn't have to clean, cook, or organize anything! The children would be able to play in their nursery or the backyard with the latest
                anti-stranger guardian bots to ensure their safety! Plus, you'll be able to happily play with your children during your free time and whenever you want to. 
                Wake up early in the morning for some breakfast? Done. The bots had already made you scrambled eggs, toast, and orange juice. Need to stay awake for your baby bundle of joy? 
                The robots already got you covered, they can swaddle and feed the baby while you rest and sleep, knowing they'll be safe in your house! Kids alone in the house while you and your
                spouse are away? The house already put out their defensive measures and already called the police on home intruders! Take a preview huh?

            <h1><strong>The Features!</strong></h1>
            <main>Hey, not only are we providing you the beauty and envy of a house, we're also here for practicality!
            The robotic features of the house are to envy for, and hey, with the current hot tensions between the United States of America
            and Russia, this house is able to withstand radiation and chemical warfare like nothing! Why don't we take a look on our gadgets to
            survive our coming apocalypse?

            <h2><em>The Brain</em></h2>
            <p>We like to call this "The Brain." Why? You may ask. The thing is, the Brain is your ever faithful servant.
                It controls the house's functions to your demands. Too hot outside? The Brain will cool the house down for you! Want a midnight snack?
                Why not, the Brain will make the kitchen cook for you whatever treat you wish! Need to make a busy and workable
                schedule? The Brain already filed and compiled everything on your list into an easy to digest schedule and it works fast,
                it can even adapt to last minute changes! Consider it done! The Brain is able to protect itself with self-automatic lights
                so those horrible techno night burglers won't know if someone is inside the house or not. By fooling them with routinual light switching!
                And hey, remember your cat or dog who always wanted to go outside and get lost? No worries, your little animal companions would be able to
                get in or outside whenever they want to with a simple "bark!" or "meow!" to the door. And don't worry, you can also set up a time in the house to let it know when it is allowed or not
                to let your pets go outside! And hey remember those pesky government birds that try to pry into your private solitude? No worries. The house is able to detect
                and "shake off" those governmental tech off your house by closing the blinds instantly! Privacy secured.
            </p>
            <aside>Did you know that 89% of techno burglers record your voice to get inside your house with the automatic voice door opener? Fear not!
                This house has the lastest authentic indentification tech that helps it indentify the differences between your recorded voice and your real one!
                Identify theft and thievery is no joke! We prioritize your identity and safety!
            </aside>

            <h3><em>The Automated Convience</em></h3>
            <p>Homemakers, this is for you! We have an excellent selection of convience to your repetitive lives. The house has clocks decorated around the house, they don't 
                only tell the time, they're your schedule makers, your assitants, your faithful servants who tell you all the gossip and updates.
            </p>
            <p>Next up is the kitchen! Where all of your meals are handled with professional care that could rival Chef Rordon Gamsay's cooking. Want it to be homely or professional? Japanese? Indian? Italian? 
                The kitchen got you all covered. The highlight of the show would be the stove; able to complete dishes in a matter of minutes and without any salmonella! Breakfast is its specialty, with 
                perfect sunnyside up eggs, warm toasted bed, orange juice, and sizzling bacon. Right early in the morning where you, your children, and your spouse can enjoy a lovely breakfast before the bus arrives.
