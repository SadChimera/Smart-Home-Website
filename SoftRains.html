                where you can see the city from afar and gloat about your own freedom, under the sun and shining green grass and have a couple of dogs run around happy.
                Upgraded with most recent of technologies to create a comfortable future for you and your family! With the implementations of robotic and synthetic tech,
                the caregiver of the house wouldn't have to clean, cook, or organize anything! The children would be able to play in their nursery or the backyard with the latest
                anti-stranger guardian bots to ensure their safety! Plus, you'll be able to happily play with your children during your free time and whenever you want to. 
                Wake up early in the morning for some breakfast? Done. The bots had already made you scrambled eggs, toast, and orange juice. Need to stay awake for your baby bundle of joy? 
                The robots already got you covered, they can swaddle and feed the baby while you rest and sleep, knowing they'll be safe in your house! Kids alone in the house while you and your
                spouse are away? The house already put out their defensive measures and already called the police on home intruders! Take a preview huh?

            <h4><em>The Automated Cleaning!</em></h4>
            <p class="content" class="flex-daddy">Homemakers, the cleaning can be a hassle and trouble to endure through everyday! So, we figured that these ammenities would be of great use to you.</p>
            <p>First off, we have the self-autonomous dishwashers/aluminum wedge that would surely reduce the workload off of your hands and make it sparkling clean in seconds!</p>
            <img src="https://media.us.lg.com/transform/96303319-bc70-455f-b676-dbec7ff3a4bb/Dishwashers_lifestyle_hero_banner_900x600" width='250' alt="The Dishwasher"/>
            <p class="content" class="flex-daddy">Next up may seem a bit intense, but we have the incinerator! This thing is highly dangerous and fortunately located in the cellar where none of your kids will ever step into! According to house and waste regulations, 
                this is a better alternative than throwing out your garbage out into those poor oceans and forests! And plus, when you have food or things to throw out, always throw it in here.</p>

            <p class="content" class="flex-daddy">Your next little helpers are the dust mice and the fire rats, as we like to affectionately call them. The little mice clean up dust and crumbs, pretty useful for preventing ants crawling their way in and making rent. The 
                fire rats carry larger pieces of items and throw them out into the incinerator to dispose of them. Additionally, they make good little pets if you don't like actual hair or saliva from live pets.

            <h5><em>Safety!</em></h5>
            <p class="content" class="flex-daddy">There are safety functions everywhere inside the house! All to protect you and your family from danger and disaters that may occur! First off, is the fire alarm which speaks in a loud and audible frequency all around the house 
                so that everyone is aware of the danger! Then there are the ceiling walls that spout out water in case of a fire emergency in the kitchen! And no, we're not implying that our tech is faulty. The water rats are another variant of rats, 
                capable of shooting out water at fast and high does at fire. Next up is the snakes! Don't worry, these snakes spout out green chemicals to get rid of lingering fire patches faster than water!
