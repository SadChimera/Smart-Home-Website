            <h4><em>The Automated Cleaning!</em></h4>
            <p class="content" class="flex-daddy">Homemakers, the cleaning can be a hassle and trouble to endure through everyday! So, we figured that these ammenities would be of great use to you.</p>
            <p>First off, we have the self-autonomous dishwashers/aluminum wedge that would surely reduce the workload off of your hands and make it sparkling clean in seconds!</p>
            <img src="https://media.us.lg.com/transform/96303319-bc70-455f-b676-dbec7ff3a4bb/Dishwashers_lifestyle_hero_banner_900x600" width='250' alt="The Dishwasher"/>
            <p class="content" class="flex-daddy">Next up may seem a bit intense, but we have the incinerator! This thing is highly dangerous and fortunately located in the cellar where none of your kids will ever step into! According to house and waste regulations, 
                this is a better alternative than throwing out your garbage out into those poor oceans and forests! And plus, when you have food or things to throw out, always throw it in here.</p>

            <p class="content" class="flex-daddy">Your next little helpers are the dust mice and the fire rats, as we like to affectionately call them. The little mice clean up dust and crumbs, pretty useful for preventing ants crawling their way in and making rent. The 
                fire rats carry larger pieces of items and throw them out into the incinerator to dispose of them. Additionally, they make good little pets if you don't like actual hair or saliva from live pets.
