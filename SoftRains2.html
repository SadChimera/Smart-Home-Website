                And hey, remember your cat or dog who always wanted to go outside and get lost? No worries, your little animal companions would be able to
                get in or outside whenever they want to with a simple "bark!" or "meow!" to the door. And don't worry, you can also set up a time in the house to let it know when it is allowed or not
                to let your pets go outside! And hey remember those pesky government birds that try to pry into your private solitude? No worries. The house is able to detect
                and "shake off" those governmental tech off your house by closing the blinds instantly! Privacy secured.</p class="center-content">
